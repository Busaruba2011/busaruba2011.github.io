# Busaruba2011

Hey, I'm Busaruba2011 and I love coding!
I'm currently learning lots of things. Some include: C#, Unity Game Engine, HTML and more!

### How I got into coding and game development
I love gaming, and one day I thought I should make my own games. I got Unity and had a little play around. I made a karting game with the [Unity karting microgame](https://learn.unity.com/project/karting-template) but didn't publish it because it was rubbish.
Then, another day, I decided to make my own programs. I messed with WinForms in Visual Studio, and thought 'I could make a to-do list app with the textboxes in WinForms!' And that's how it started for me.
